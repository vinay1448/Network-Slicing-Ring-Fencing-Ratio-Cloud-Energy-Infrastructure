# Devising a Network Slicing Ring Fencing Ratio for Cloud Energy Infrastructure

Disparate differences in total energy consumption by heterogeneous architectures often magnify through designed network topologies in cloud energy data centers that contrast sharply against the actualized energy consumption. A preliminary correlation can be drawn by how network operators design high-quality "Network Slices" composed of logical ring fences akin to Radio Access Networks (RANs) through end-to-end network slicing that reduces the network "churn" often associated with large losses of energy consumption in cloud energy infrastructures.

This project proposes an ideal network slicing-to-ring fencing ratio through an **Iterative Heuristic Energy-Aware Non-Convex equation** that optimizes cloud architectural management through optimal convergence in energy consumption with refined computational execution time. 

### Key Achievements:
- **Efficiency Gain**: 91.46% in total energy consumption using the proposed equation.
- **Comparative Benchmarking**:
  - Heuristic AUGMENT Non-Convex Algorithm (63.89% efficiency gain).
  - Priority Selection Offloading Algorithm (58.6% efficiency gain).
- **Optimized Metrics**: Benchmarked speed in convergence with overall energy consumption and computational execution time.

By ensuring a balance in idealized energy consumption, this network-slicing ring-fencing ratio provides optimal solutions for network architects, operators, and clients.
